# Parker Booth - Sports Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hello, I am Parker Booth! I have an analytical background in Quantitative Analysis, Business Analytics, and Econometrics. Currently, I am studying in the Master of Statistics program at the University of Utah, with plans to graduate in the Spring of 2025. I am passionate about using my acquired data analysis skills in the sports industry to help athletes reach their highest potential.

Throughout my studies, I have honed my analytical skills using economic data through various projects with federal economic data. My primary tools for these projects were R programming and Stata. 

I also have significant experience in a sports setting as a Sports Science Intern in the Applied Health & Performance Science department at the University of Utah. This opportunity has given me experience with data analysis in a sports setting using R programming and Power BI to analyze athlete data to improve performance.
