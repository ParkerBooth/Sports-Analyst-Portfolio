# Parker Booth - Sports Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hello, I am Parker Booth! I have an analytical background in Quantitative Analysis, Business Analytics, and Econometrics. I am currently studying in the Master of Statistics program at the University of Utah. I am passionate about using my acquired data analysis skills in sports to help athletes reach their highest potential.

During my studies, I have honed my analytical skills using economic data. I have done multiple projects with federal economic data that honed my skills. I primarily coded in R studio and Stata during this timeframe.

I have experience in a sports setting at the University of Utah as a Sports Science Intern with the Applied Health & Performance Science department. This opportunity has given me experience with data analysis in a sports setting. I have done multiple projects with athlete data to improve athlete performance.
